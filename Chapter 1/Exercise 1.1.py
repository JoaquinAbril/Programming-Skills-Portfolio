# Exercise 1: Print Strings
# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format.
print("Twinkle, Twinkle, little star,\n\t How I wonder what you are!\n\t\t\t Up above the world so high,\n\t\t\t Like a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\t How I wonder what you are!") # "\n" is used to break down the sentences while "\t" is used to give space.
